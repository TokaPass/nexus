## Features


## Installation
We're currently building a cli tool called [Tin](https://github.com/TokaPass/tin)

But here are the manual installation steps:
- Copy this repository
- Install packages
- Build the frontend and the backend via `build` command
- Start both frontend and backend (you can make them a service with systemctl if you want)
- Enjoy

## Usage
See the [Toka wiki](https://github.com/TokaPass/docs) for more information on how to configure and run the Toka.
